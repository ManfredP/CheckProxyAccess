CheckProxyAccess
================
A tool to check a list of web servers over different proxy servers. Very useful for migrations, to check if the new
proxy servers can reach all the sites.

This tool works, but is absolutely not user friendly, if you want to know the command line parameters, you have to
read the Config class. I'll fix that in a future version.
